    * **Note**: Choose desktop client when selecting the application type.  

4) Run the File

    * You'll immediately see your browser opened and asking you to sign in into your google account. Select the appropriate account.

## Use cases
1.  Trying to play songs from Spotify Playlists on [Discord] server using [Rhythm Bot] manually? Convert your spotify playlist to Youtube playlist and just play the playlist
2.  Want to watch your favorite music playlists music videos on screen, convert your playlist using SpotifyYouTubeGeneratePlaylist
3.  And many more......

## Limitation
1.   Google's API quota limit for a day is 10,000 counts. One search request costs 100 units and one playlist insert query costs 50 units. 
So I had to limit adding 50 videos per day.
2.  You have to manually update the Spotify authorization token after it expires every time.

## ToDo
* Tests
* Add Error Handling
* Pagination Handling (Spotify)
* Workaround for [Youtube Data API v3] daily quota limits for searching

## Troubleshooting
* Spotify Oauth token expires very quickly, If you come across a `KeyError` this could
be caused by an expired token. So just refer back to step 3 in local setup, and generate a new
token!
* Google's API quota limit for a day is 10,000 counts. One search request costs 100 units and one playlist insert query costs 50 units.
So I had to limit adding 50 videos per day.
